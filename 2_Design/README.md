### Atemga 328 Microcontroller - 
* The ATmega328 is a single-chip microcontroller. 
* ATmega328 is an Advanced Virtual RISC (AVR) microcontroller. 
* It supports 8-bit data processing. ATmega-328 has 32KB internal flash memory.
* It has an EEPROM memory of 1KB and its SRAM memory is 2KB. 

### Potentiometer as Sensor - 
* A potentiometer sensor measures the quality of the water in percentage and converts it into an electrical signal.
* Potentiometer Sensors detect the position of something which means that they are referenced either to or from some fixed point or position. 
* These types of sensors provide a “positional” feedback.
* The potentiometer is used because it is an inexpensive and easy to use position sensor. 

### Actuator ( Switch ) - 
* An actuator is a device that alters the physical quantity as it can cause a mechanical component to move after getting some input from the sensor.
* The control signal comes from a microcontroller programmed by software. 
* It receives control input (generally in the form of the electrical signal).
* It generates a change in the physical system through producing force, heat, motion, etc. 

### LCD Display - 
* A liquid crystal display, better known as an LCD, is an excellent way for a microcontroller to present visible information. 
* Most include sophisticated electronics that accept data and convert the data to letters, numbers, and symbols that appear on the display. 
* LCDs can display output from the microcontroller that has been asked by the user. 

### LED Bulb - 
* The LEDs are simple electronic display units available.
* It is mostly used for indication purposes. 
* It is used widely as indicator during test for checking the validity of results at different stages.
* It is very cheap and easily available in variety of shape, color and size. 

### Resister - 
* A Resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element.
* Resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, to divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines. 

### Voltage Source - 
* It is a voltage source that supplies fixed amount volatge ( 5V ) to the microcontroller.
